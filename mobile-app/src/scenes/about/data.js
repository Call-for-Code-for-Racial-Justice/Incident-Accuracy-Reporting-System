export const missionStatement = "We currently live in an environment where we are finding more instances where law enforcement agencies are racially biased and are conducting unlawful practices and policies (e.g. \"dirty policing\"). The practices and policies are shaping the methodology by which data is created which increases inaccurate, skewed or systemically biased information. The lack of transparent and accurate data available to assess police behavioral infractions means, police reports can be falsified and covered up."
