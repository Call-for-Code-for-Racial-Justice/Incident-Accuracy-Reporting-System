# 1. Overview
## Embrace Theme 
### Police & Judicial Reform and Accountability: 
From traffic stops and arrests to sentencing and parole decisions, use technology to better analyze real-world data, provide insights, and make recommendations that will drive racial equality and reform across criminal justice and public safety.

### Problem Statement: 
The lack of transparent and accurate data available to assess police behavioral infractions means, police reports can be falsified and contain other inaccuracies.

This solution addresses the hill outlined below related to the problem statement above:

### Hill: 
Internal affairs and civilians (such as witnesses) can both contribute to incident reports, creating a tamper-proof record with all accounts of the incident.

# 2. The Idea

A Content Management application for capturing statements from first-hand individuals relating to police incident reports. 
* Interface for first-hand individuals to input information or data related to incident report
* Automated/Manual flagging of errors and inaccuracies contained in initial incident reports based on collected data
* Cross reference report data with officer history on misconduct
* Mechanism for disputing claims in incident reports
 
# 3. How It Works

## Solution:


### Consideration

* If a 911 call is made, the event’s address, date, and time is logged as an incident. 

* An incident may or may not be given a case number 
* Incidents reported via app can be linked by provided case number (if known), or by correlating the submitted metadata(location, date, and time)  with a logged incident from the police department
* If an event has not yet been logged as an incident by the police department (ex: occurring live at a protest), reported incidents submitted through app can be tagged as pending until a matching police incident can be linked once filed.  


### Included Technology Components

* Web Application: built using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend framework. This can be run locally or on IBM Cloud. The web application provides the dashboard and is at the core of the solution.
* [Watson Speech To Text](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text):  This is a IBM Cloud service that converts human voice into written text. This application uses it to create written transcripts from audio recordings loaded by witnesses and victims.
* [Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant):  (lite Tier) is a distributed, document-oriented NoSQL database that is running on the IBM Cloud.
* [Blockchain](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/): Based on the open-soure enterprise grade permissioned disributed ledger; Hyperledger Fabric. The blockchain network is an immutable transaction ledger. This was used to ensure that the submitted reports and information from victims and witnesses are tamper-proof. Each stored document has a hash tag that is stored in the Blockchain. You can run the application without it.
* [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage): (lite tier) stores encrypted and dispersed data. Documents(incident reports, videos, audios) are  IBM Cloud Object Storage.
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): an open source, cross-platform solution to record, converrt and stream audio and videos. This was used to transcribe the audio portion of a video.
* Machine Learning - K-Means Clustering

# 4. Design 

## Persona/ User
Engaging personas emphasise how stories can engage and bring the personas to life.

## User journey: AS-IS Experience
As-is Scenario Maps help us to document collective understanding of user workflows and are best used as precursors to exploring new ideas or for finding the right problem to solve.

## User journey: TO-BE Experience
To-be Scenario Maps can help the team envision a better future for our users. We use them as we’re coming up with potential solutions to see how our ideas would fit within our user’s world, and how they might address the their needs. A To-be Scenario Map is a great artifact to put in front of stakeholders and users to align on the team’s intent.

# 7. Getting started

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Container-based software that standardizes a unit of software and enables developers to isolate their app from the environmen
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a JavaScript Framework
- [NPM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
- Register for an [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42793&eventid=cfc-2020?cm_mmc=OSocial_Blog-_-Audience+Developer_Developer+Conversation-_-WW_WW-_-cfc-2020-ghub-starterkit-cooperation_ov75914&cm_mmca1=000039JL&cm_mmca2=10008917) account.
- Install and configure [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#overview).

## Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
1. [Run the application](#2-run-the-application)
1. [Start and configure the Blockchain application](#3-start-and-configure-the-blockchain-application)

> NOTE: Create an [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) account, if you do not have one already

## 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/lions-of-justice
```
## 2. Run the application

To start the server for the web application

```
git clone https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/lions-of-justice
cd lions-of-justice
cd frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```

To start the web application (ensure you are in the same directory as whe)

```
npm start
```

## 3. Start and configure the Blockchain application

This step will start the network in a docker image, create a network channel and join a peer

```
cd backend/blockchain/local
./startFabric.sh
```

Follow the instructions in the following pattern to start the Blockchain application

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Blockchain-for-maintaining-Digital-Assets
```

# 8. IARS Recommendations for Enhancements of Capabilities

**Incident Accuracy Reporting System (IARS)**

### Ideas for Extending IARS Functionality
xxxxxx

### Ideas for Extending IARS Technically

- Support for multi-cloud, multi-networks: deploying the application across any cloud platform or a multi-cloud platform. This is especially important if the system may want to be run across state lines and different Cloud platforms are used.  Also if different blockchain networks are used - it makes it easier to interconnect "mixed networks". Consider deploying on top of RH OpenShift.
- Adding mobile support
- Adding container security software: lifecycle vulnerability management for scanning containers (on RHM: Neuvector)
